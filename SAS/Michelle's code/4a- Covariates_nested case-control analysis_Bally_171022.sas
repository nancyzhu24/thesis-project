*/ Original RAMQ study - 
(ref: Brophy JM, Levesque LE, Zhang B. 
The coronary risk of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors in patients with a previous myocardial infarction. Heart. 2007:93(2):189-94.) */

Demographic variables were: age (matched) and gender (unmatched)
In the year before cohort entry (first NSAID prescription after study start) documented comorbid conditions were:
hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, previous MI,
congestive heart failure, diabetes, respiratory illness,gastrointestinal ulcer disease, thyroid disorders,
depression/psychiatric illness, and cancer
In the year before cohort entry (first NSAID prescription after study start) documented use of medications was:
low-dose ASA, anticoagulants, oral corticosteroids, and antilipidemic agents
In the year preceding the index date, healthcare utilisation was documented by: hospitalizations (none, >=1),
all doctor visits (<=12, >12), cardiologist visits (none, >=1)
In the year preceding the index date, comorbidity indices were: Charlson index, number of different drugs, 
and chronic disease score;

*******************************************************************************************************************
*/ RAMQ nested case-control dataset included in preliminary IPD MA */

* The rationale for selection of potentially confounding variables and time of assessment is the causal diagram (DAG)
for exposure to NSAIDs and acute myocardial infarction outcome.

*/ List of defined covariates for IPD MA */

* Decision M. Bally and J. Brophy (2013-07-23):
Comorbidities: coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, 
previous MI, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, COPD, GI ulcer disease, GI bleed, renal failure (acute and chronic), 
Concomitant specific drugs: low-dose ASA, anticoagulants, oral corticosteroids, and clopidogrel 

*/ Justification for not including certain covariates in the preliminary IPD MA dataset */ 

* Although they were included in the original RAMQ study (Brophy 2007), will not include the following covariates
for the IPD MA: cancer, thyroid disease, or psychiatric disease
Reason is that these three comorbidities are not part of the DAG for NSAID exposure and AMI outcome

* Will include COPD rather than respiratory illness and cerebrovascular disease instead of stroke 
Reasons are that COPD excludes bronchitis and asthma and is therefore preferred over respiratory illness and that
cerebrovascular disease is less restrictive than stroke

* Will not include arrhythmia because although the causal diagram for 
NSAID exposure and AMI outcome includes arrhythmia, their under documentation is a concern

* Will not include obesity, valvular heart disease, other rheumatic inflammatory diseases because although
these are part of the DAG, obesity is likely very misclassified while valvular heart disease
and other rheumatic inflammatory diseases are most likely to be dropped from model (very low prevalence in RAMQ)

* Will not include antilipidemic agents but will keep the following concomitant drugs: use of anticoagulants, 
use of low-dose ASA, use of oral corticosteroids.
Additionally will include clopidogrel (available for RAMQ and Finland but not Sask or GPRD)
Justified because of antilipidemic agents is already part of definition of hyperlipidemia (therefore collinearity)
and clopidogrel use is included in the DAG for NSAID exposure and AMI outcome and available in RAMQ and Finland

* Healthcare utilisation and comorbidity indices are not available in other IPD MA datasets 
(Finland, GPRD) and will not be defined for the RAMQ IPD MA dataset;

*/ Definition of comorbidities and assessment timepoints for covariates for preliminary work for IPD MA */

* Comorbidities are defined using hospitalizations with or without prescription drugs (plus procedures for CHD)

* For determination of covariates, 3 programs were written with a different time window for 
prescription-defined comorbidities and concomitant drugs: program 'Base covariates' defined for
prescriptions one year prior to cohort entry (similarly to original RAMQ study), 
program 'Index covariates' defined for prescriptions one year prior to cohort entry up to index date
and program 'Index covariates Rx yr PTID' defined for prescriptions one year prior to index date.
These serve as sensitivity analyses.

* In the 2 'Index covariates' programs, hospitalization-defined comorbidities and procedure-defined comorbidities
are determined for the period of one year before cohort entry up to the index date (and not in the one year prior to cohort entry).
For prior MI, can only document for hospitalization in the period before cohort entry. Because AMI is the
outcome, any MI occurring after cohort entry is an cohort exit defining event.
For coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease, will additionally document 
by hospitalisations in the period before the index date.
For hypertension, congestive heart failure, and renal disease, hospitalizations are documented for the period
of one year before cohort entry up to one year prior to index date (see below for justification);

*/ Rationale for change in time period in which covariates are asssessed */

* Change from 'baseline' in Brophy 2007 (i.e. in the year prior to cohort entry)to 'concurrent' in IPD MA is
justified based on:
1) the attempt to more fully capture the occurrence of comorbidities and
2) to minimize the misclassification of these potential confounders, 
considering the longer duration of the RAMQ study re-designed for the IPD MA 
(11.75 years in IPD MA RAMQ study vs 4 years in orignal study - Brophy 2007)

EXCEPTIONS FOR HOSPITALIZATION-DEFINED COVARIATES: 
1) For coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, will additionally document 
by hospitalisations in the period before the index date. The time window is broader for these comorbidities 
a) because they cannot be determined specifically from drug treatments and 
b) because we consider hospitalization codes for CHD or CVD to have good sensitivity. 
A more restrictive time window is likely to miss the presence of these comorbidities.
2) NSAIDs are known to be associated with increases in blood pressure, new onset of congestive heart failure
or its deterioration, and deteriorating renal function. 
Whenever these covariates are defined by hospitalizations, to avoid overadjustment i.e. adjusting for a
variable on the causal pathway (the main analysis is not done with a marginal structural model),
we do not include hospitalizations in the year before index date for these covariates;

******************************************************************************************************************
/* RAMQ nested case-control dataset for final analyses: 1) as single study and 
2) for inclusion in an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD MA)	 */

* Data available from RAMQ does not allow for markers of severity 
e.g. no measure of BP, renal function or ejection fraction,
for corresponding comorbidities (i.e. HTA, renal disease, CHF) that are also mediators on the causal pathway
between NSAID use and AMI.
Indeed, once a subject is diagnosed with HTA, CHF or renal disease, this is carried forward to cohort exit.
Consequently, a marginal structural model cannot be used in this database study to adjust for these 
time-varying covariates, which depend on previous NSAID exposure;

* For the recency-weighted cumulative exposure (WCE) analysis, comorbidities must be determined concurrently
with time-varying exposure (determination of date of first occurence of each chronic comorbidity);

/* Rationale for choice of time window */

* Four different programs were written for determining covariates:

- For analysis of RAMQ as a single study
  1) a specificity-maximizing strategy (Sp)
  2) a sensitivity-maximizing strategy (Se)
  
  3) a strategy balancing specificity and sensitivity (SpSe)

  These first 3 scenarios determine the presence or absence of each chronic comorbidity and concomitant drug treatment,
  at index date. The time windows for assessing these covariates vary in these three strategies and also depend on the source
  of raw RAMQ data (i.e. hospitalizations, procedures, prescriptions - see below).
  Using same data presentation as in Brophy et al. Heart. 2007:93(2):189-94, the effect of determining comorbidities
  and concomitant drug treatments with reference to different time windows (e.g. before cohort entry, before 
  index date) on inferences on AMI risk with NSAID will be explored in a sensitivity analysis of the RAMQ dataset (single study)

 - For preparing the RAMQ dataset to be used in the IPD MA, the Sp Se-balancing strategy will be applied

 - For preparing the RAMQ dataset to be used in the recency-weighted cumulative exposure (WCE) analysis 
   4) a strategy balancing Se and Sp with the same time windows as the Sp Se-balancing strategy described above is used for the 
      WCE analysis.
	  However, instead of simply assessing presence or absence of each chronic comorbidity and concomitant drug treatment,
      at index date it also determines the date of first occurence of each chronic comorbidity,
	  therefore adjusting for time-varying values of comorbidities and concomitant drug treatments over the cohort duration

To avoid overadjustment i.e. adjusting for a variable on the causal pathway, since the main analysis is not 
done with a marginal structural model, we do not record hospitalizations after start of first NSAID prescription and
we determine these comorbidities in the period in which this population of incident users can be confirmed to be
free of NSAID (since the cohort is not composed of first-time users, we cannot rule out that subjects may have had pre-exisiting
